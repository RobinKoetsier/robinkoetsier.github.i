Welcome! 
 </p>
This site serves as an personal site for my data and blog posts. (Very much still work in progress)
  
 <p> 
I will mostly write about Dutch football.
On my Twitter profile you can follow me for visualisations of Eredivisie matches and other stuff. 
Besides that, I wrote some shiny apps that you can find under the link to my external stuff.
