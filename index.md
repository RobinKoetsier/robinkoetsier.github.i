<p>
Welcome! 
  
This site serves as an personal site for my data and blog posts. 
  
  
I will mostly write about Dutch football.
On my Twitter profile you can follow me for visualisations of Eredivisie matches and other stuff. 
Besides that, I wrote some shiny apps that you can find under the link to my external stuff.
