This post is about Expected Points

Read the Dutch version of this article [here](https://www.tussendelinies.nl/expected-points/)

You probably read already about it, or saw it in some tweet/picture/anything, Expected Points. From understat to Opta, they are all using it. There are some different ways to calculate it though. In this article I will tell you my method, the method we use for our dashboard at [Tussen de Linies](https://www.tussendelinies.nl/data-dashboard)

#### XPOINTS?
What can we do with xPoints and do we need it?  
We can use xPoints to see where we may expect a team in the league table. In short: it is a way to show how well they perform this season, looking at their shots.  
Raw xG numbers don't say everything, as the quality of the chances plays a role as well.

#### AN EXAMPLE
Let's take a look at the game FC Groningen against FC Twente. The game ended in 2-2 with xG 1.9 and 1.5. In the table you'll see the chances for both teams to win.
