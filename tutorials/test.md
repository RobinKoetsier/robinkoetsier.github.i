As I really like the radars from football slices (RIP) and the mplsoccer package for Python, I was thinking about making them in R with the help of the [worldfootballR package.](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR). When some people contacted me with the question if I knew how to do it, I decided to make a tutorial for it. If you don't know what I'm talking about, this is the radar from mplsoccer.
